## Known bugs
When in the `Pen` (spawing room), it doesn't mention the `raw-egg` on the ground, but you can still pick it up

## Solution (SPOILER)

This is not the only solution, and may not be the most efficient solution. But it works (in 12 moves). 

```
pickup raw-egg
go north
pickup onion
pickup cilantro
pickup tomato
go south
go west
prepare vegetables
go east
go south
go south
pickup bowl
pickup fork
go north
crack egg
go east
beat egg
go w 
go n
go e
cook egg
go e
eat egg
```
